Wow... Loved this place.	1
Crust is not good.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0
The fries were great too.	1
A great touch.	1
Service was very prompt.	1
Would not go back.	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!	1
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
Highly recommended.	1
Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0
did not like at all.	0
The Burrittos Blah!	0
The food, amazing.	1
Service is also cute.	1
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	1
So they performed.	1
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	1
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	1
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	1
This was like the final blow!	0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0
Overall, I like this place a lot.	1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1
Ample portions and good prices.	1
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1
Service sucks.	0
The shrimp tender and moist.	1
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	1
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	1
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1
Their chow mein is so good!	1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
The portion was huge!	1
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	1
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1
We'd definitely go back here again.	1
We are so glad we found this place.	1
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	1
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	1
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
A great way to finish a great.	1
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	1
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1
The service was meh.	0
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
This place has it!	1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1
Omelets are to die for!	1
Everything was fresh and delicious!	1
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	1
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	0
Best breakfast buffet!!!	1
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
We'll never go again.	0
Will be back again!	1
Food arrived quickly!	1
It was not good.	0
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	1
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1
Will go back next trip out.	1
Sooooo good!!	1
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	1
Nice, spicy and tender.	1
Good prices.	1
Check it out.	1
It was pretty gross!	0
I've had better atmosphere.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1
I wouldn't return.	0
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
Penne vodka excellent!	1
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	1
The management is rude.	0
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	1
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1
Don't do it!!!!	0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0
I give it 2 thumbs down	0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	1
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1
this place is good.	1
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0
I was seated immediately.	1
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1
Avoid at all cost!	0
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1
DELICIOUS!!	1
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0
I've never been treated so bad.	0
Bacon is hella salty.	1
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1
The waitresses are very friendly.	1
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
It was probably dirt.	0
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
Interesting decor.	1
What I really like there is the crepe station.	1
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	1
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	1
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	1
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
Very friendly staff.	1
It is worth the drive.	1
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1
Food was great and so was the serivce!	1
The warm beer didn't help.	0
Great brunch spot.	1
Service is friendly and inviting.	1
Very good lunch spot.	1
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
Must have been an off night at this place.	0
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	1
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0
My friend loved the salmon tartar.	1
Won't go back.	0
Extremely Tasty!	1
Waitress was good though!	1
Soggy and not good.	0
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	1
Which are small and not worth the price.	0
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	1
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0
The service was a bit lacking.	0
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	1
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	1
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	1
As for the "mains," also uninspired.	0
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
Very very fun chef.	1
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.	0
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	1
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	1
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
Now this dish was quite flavourful.	1
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0
Owner's are really great people.!	1
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	0
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	1
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	1
Fantastic service here.	1
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
They know how to make them here.	1
very tough and very short on flavor!	0
I hope this place sticks around.	1
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	1
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	1
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	1
Plus, it's only 8 bucks.	1
The service was not up to par, either.	0
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	1
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	1
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	1
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	1
You can't beat that.	1
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	1
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	1
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1
I think not again	0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1
Service stinks here!	0
I waited and waited.	0
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	1
Great Pizza and Salads!	1
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
This place is amazing!	1
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
Just don't know why they were so slow.	0
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	1
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	1
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	1
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	1
Never again will I be dining at this place!	0
The food was excellent and service was very good.	1
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	1
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
Food was really boring.	0
Good Service-check!	1
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0
Will never, ever go back.	0
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	0
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1
I did not expect this to be so good!	1
Fantastic food!	1
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
The food was very good.	1
Never going back.	0
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	1
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	1
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1
All the bread is made in-house!	1
The only downside is the service.	0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	1
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	1
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	1
You won't be disappointed.	1
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	1
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	1
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	1
Everything was gross.	0
I love this place.	1
Great service and food.	1
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0
The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.	0
OMG, the food was delicioso!	1
There is nothing authentic about this place.	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	1
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	1
It's worth driving up from Tucson!	1
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
Pretty good beer selection too.	1
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	1
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	1
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	1
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
He was terrible!	0
Everyone is treated equally special.	1
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.	0
It was delicious!!!	1
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	1
Best fish I've ever had in my life!	1
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)	1
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	0
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	1
Pretty cool I would say.	1
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.	1
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	0
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	1
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.	1
He deserves 5 stars.	1
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
They dropped more than the ball.	0
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
Best tacos in town by far!!	1
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.	1
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0
I won't be back.	0
They have great dinners.	1
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	1
The food was terrible.	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	1
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	0
This is a disgrace.	0
Def coming back to bowl next time	1
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.	1
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.	1
I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.	1
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	1
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	1
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	1
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	1
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1
This one is simply a disappointment.	0
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.	1
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	1
Left very frustrated.	0
I'll definitely be in soon again.	1
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	1
Service was fantastic.	1
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	0
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	1
Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!	1
For service, I give them no stars.	0
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	1
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
But now I was completely grossed out.	0
I really enjoyed eating here.	1
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.	1
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	1
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	1
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0
What a mistake that was!	0
No complaints!	1
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1
Waiter was a jerk.	0
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	0
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	1
I never come again.	0
We loved the biscuits!!!	1
Service is quick and friendly.	1
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
So absolutley fantastic.	1
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0
definitely will come back here again.	1
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	1
Wow very spicy but delicious.	1
If you're not familiar, check it out.	1
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	0
I'd love to go back.	1
Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	1
Nothing special.	0
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	1
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	1
Will not be back.	0
Sauce was tasteless.	0
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	1
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	1
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	0
Food was so gooodd.	1
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	0
I was so insulted.	0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	0
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	1
Nargile - I think you are great.	1
Best tater tots in the southwest.	1
We loved the place.	1
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	0
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	1
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.	1
The manager was the worst.	0
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	1
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
Love the margaritas, too!	1
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	1
Very good, though!	1
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0
Great pork sandwich.	1
Don't waste your time here.	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	1
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.	1
I LOVED it!	1
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.	1
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
The selection of food was not the best.	0
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	1
This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	1
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	0
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0
How awesome is that.	1
I will be back many times soon.	1
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	1
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	1
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	1
And then tragedy struck.	0
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	1
This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!	1
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	1
Waitress was sweet and funny.	1
I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!	1
I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	0
Cant say enough good things about this place.	1
The ambiance was incredible.	1
The waitress and manager are so friendly.	1
I would not recommend this place.	0
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0
My gyro was basically lettuce only.	0
Terrible service!	0
Thoroughly disappointed!	0
I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.	1
Give it a try, you will be happy you did.	1
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!	1
Reasonably priced also!	1
Everything was perfect the night we were in.	1
The food is very good for your typical bar food.	1
it was a drive to get there.	0
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	1
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	1
Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.	1
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	1
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
first time there and might just be the last.	0
Those burgers were amazing.	1
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
And it was way to expensive.	0
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.	1
The bartender was also nice.	1
Everything was good and tasty!	1
This place is two thumbs up....way up.	1
The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.	1
If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.	1
Terrible management.	0
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	0
Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	1
Worst martini ever!	0
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.	1
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	1
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	1
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	0
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.	1
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	1
not even a "hello, we will be right with you."	0
The desserts were a bit strange.	0
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	1
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1
Nice ambiance.	1
I would recommend saving room for this!	1
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!	1
I *heart* this place.	1
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
After two I felt disgusting.	0
A good time!	1
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.	1
Generous portions and great taste.	1
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"	0
Food was delicious!	1
AN HOUR... seriously?	0
I consider this theft.	0
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
Waited and waited and waited.	0
He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.	1
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	1
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
Service was good and the company was better!	1
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.	1
As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	1
Boy was that sucker dry!!.	0
Over rated.	0
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	0
Their steaks are 100% recommended!	1
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	0
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.	1
All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	1
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0
My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.	1
The kids play area is NASTY!	0
Great place fo take out or eat in.	1
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	1
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	1
It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!	1
I really enjoyed Crema Caf√© before they expanded. I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.	1
Not good for the money.	0
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	1
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.	1
Good value, great food, great service.	1
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.	1
The food is good.	1
It was awesome.	1
I just wanted to leave.	0
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!	1
I will not be eating there again.	0
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.	0
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	0
An absolute must visit!	1
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.	1
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	0
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	0
They really want to make your experience a good one.	1
I will not return.	0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
Very disappointing!!!	0
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	1
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
Pretty awesome place.	1
Ambience is perfect.	1
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	0
The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!	1
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !	1
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!	1
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	0
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	1
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	0
We were promptly greeted and seated.	1
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	0
This is a good joint.	1
The Macarons here are insanely good.	1
I'm not eating here!	0
Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.	1
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
Very bad Experience!	0
What a mistake.	0
Food was average at best.	0
Great food.	1
We won't be going back anytime soon!	0
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.	0
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	1
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	1
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0
The patio seating was very comfortable.	1
The fried rice was dry as well.	0
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	1
That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.	1
It was just not a fun experience.	1
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	1
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!	1
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	1
Both great!	1
Eclectic selection.	1
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	1
The staff was very attentive.	1
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	1
The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.	1
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	0
dont go here.	0
I promise they won't disappoint.	1
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	0
What a great double cheeseburger!	1
Awesome service and food.	1
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	1
I can't wait to go back.	1
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	1
Service was slow and not attentive.	0
I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.	1
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.	1
Very good food, great atmosphere.1	1
Damn good steak.	1
Total brunch fail.	0
Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.	1
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	1
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	1
Good food , good service .	1
It was absolutely amazing.	1
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0
will definitely be back!	1
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	1
Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.	1
Went for lunch - service was slow.	0
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0
I was mortified.	0
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!	1
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	1
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	1
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0
The atmosphere here is fun.	1
Would not recommend to others.	0
Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!	1
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0
That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.	1
Not my thing.	0
2 Thumbs Up!!	1
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	1
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	1
They have a really nice atmosphere.	1
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0
After one bite, I was hooked.	1
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0
Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	1
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	1
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1
Awesome selection of beer.	1
Great food and awesome service!	1
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	1
As for the service, I thought it was good.	1
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1
Overall, I like there food and the service.	1
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	0
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	1
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.	1
Never had anything to complain about here.	1
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1
It was way over fried.	0
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0
Will not be back!	0
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	1
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.	1
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	1
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0
This is a GREAT place to eat!	1
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1
The service was poor and thats being nice.	0
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.	1
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0
But the service was beyond bad.	0
I'm so happy to be here!!!"	1
Tasted like dirt.	0
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1
The block was amazing.	1
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	1
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	0
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".	0
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
These were so good we ordered them twice.	1
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0
Unfortunately, it was not good.	0
I had a pretty satifying experience.	1
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	1
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	1
We will not be coming back.	0
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	1
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	1
Once your food arrives it's meh.	0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	1
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	1
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Mediocre food.	0
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
I'm super pissd.	0
And service was super friendly.	1
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
This place was such a nice surprise!	1
They were golden-crispy and delicious.	1
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	1
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
The service was terrible though.	0
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
It was packed!!	0
I love this place.	1
I can say that the desserts were yummy.	1
The food was terrible.	0
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	1
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
Do not waste your money here!	0
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1
The cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist.	1
Awful service.	0
Won't ever go here again.	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
The service here is fair at best.	0
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
Very poor service.	0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	1
They were excellent.	1
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	1
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0
The food came out at a good pace.	1
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1
I won't be back.	0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
This place deserves no stars.	0
I would not recommend this place.	0
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	1
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	1
I probably would not go here again.	0
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1
The price is reasonable and the service is great.	1
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	1
I probably won't be coming back here.	0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.	1
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
I love their fries and their beans.	1
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.	1
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.	1
The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	1
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1
Weird vibe from owners.	0
There was hardly any meat.	0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	0
Go To Place for Gyros.	1
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	0
We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	0
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
The service was extremely slow.	0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
Seriously killer hot chai latte.	1
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	1
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	1
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
Worst Thai ever.	0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	1
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1
The pizza selections are good.	1
I had strawberry tea, which was good.	1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
Overall, a great experience.	1
Spend your money elsewhere.	0
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	1
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	0
And the drinks are WEAK, people!	0
-My order was not correct.	0
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
We won't be returning.	0
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
Very, very sad.	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.	0
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	0
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
This place is disgusting!	0
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1
The RI style calamari was a joke.	0
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0
Disappointing experience.	0
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	0
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	0
We won't be going back.	0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0
This place lacked style!!	0
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0
Don't bother coming here.	0
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
It was equally awful.	0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
Con: spotty service.	0
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0
But then they came back cold.	0
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0
The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	0
But I don't like it.	0
Hell no will I go back	0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".	0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
The ambiance isn't much better.	0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
The food wasn't good.	0
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	0
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0
Overpriced for what you are getting.	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
Food was below average.	0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0
Spend your money and time some place else.	0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0
the presentation of the food was awful.	0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	0
Appetite instantly gone.	0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
Had a brilliant evening taking over the whole of the restaurant for my 70th Birthday bash.	1
Compliments are flooding in from my guests regarding the food and a enjoyable evening. Thanks Doug and Chris and thank you to the rest of the team for helping to make the night run so smoothly.	1
On behalf of us all ‚Äì thank you for making our evening such an enjoyable one! Your hard work and consideration were very much appreciated. Kindest regards.	1
Tapas evening last night another success, well done Doug and Chris & team for all your hard work, lovely food and ambience, garden looked lovely, thanks for all the heaters keeping us arm.	1
Many thanks for making June 8th a day for our daughter Lyn to remember her 60th birthday.The buffet was lovely and enjoyed by all. Please thank your staff for all their hard work and being so friendly and helpful. Also your garden looked lovely.	1
Just to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for our meal last Saturday. We all enjoyed your delicious food and the evening was everything we hoped it would be. Thank you so much.	1
Really enjoyed my lunch today, in this out of the way dinning spot.  I took public transportation with two transfers to get here, because it's not my first time.  I enjoyed two old favorites, the carpaccio salad, and the pumpkin ravioli with the pecan sauce that has a heavy dose of browned butter.  Heaven!  This time I took pictures.... here you go.	1
One of the better Italian restaurant. My party of 5 has different dishes and all of them were very good.	1
I've passed by this restaurant many times and I was craving a nice Italian meal before work. I was really impressed with the ratings and reviews, so I gave it a shot.	1
Food is delicious! If you like Italian food here is where you want to go!	1
Lady that greeted me was pleasant. They did not have what I wanted and referred me to "Little Trattoria 25"....that turned into an unpleasant experience. 5 stars for helping me with another suggestion. I just hate that my experience wasn't as good at the other location....fyi i was told that the other location was not affiliated with them.	1
Had a excellent experience here with my daughter. The food comes quickly and the service is just awesome. Prices are fair.	1
Good food. Great service. Daniel was very helpful	1
this place is outstanding. the Fettuccine with mushroom sauce and seafood is quality quality. the Cadillac margarita was strong and very tasty. my wife's birthday dinner here was perfect. intimate, flavorful and right in the corner. check it out.	1
The best class linguine ever	1
Love see food pasta!! Very nice service	1

This place has great food at great prices.I am making this place my favorite, the sports bar it's a bit small  but cozy. Come for great food stay for drinks and football.In the middle of nowhere.	1
Located in the heart of industrial Vernon (if you can believe that) this is a great iltalian resturant if you find yourself in the area doing business. You won't go wrong eating here!	1
A regular at this place. Food is awesome and great service.	1
Food was delicious. But the service was the best. We had 2 of the best servers ever. They were on it. We came in wearing our Dodger gear. Well everyone one was nicely dressed up. And for them to take care of us the way they did. Was a warm feeling. Feel in love with this place.	1
I love this place it's so beautiful in the inside the staff is very professional & Janet the event planner is great at what she does and makes you feel at ease when you're planning events.	1
Had a very good experience in this place with my son. The food came fast and the service is just good. Prices are reasonable.	1
Very clean place. Easy going waiters. Friendly environment 	1
Loved the foods and the service	1
Enjoyed a great meal today. The service was also 5 stars.	1

Good food. Fast service.	1
excellent food and excellent place !!!	1
The food is delicious and the service is great.	1
You are the best among the rest! Last Sunday, I tried to come here and try their bestseller dishes. I was so happy and satisfied with the food. I like their plating because it was so attractive. I didn't regret my decision to have my dinner in this place at that time. Excellent service! Highly recommended to everyone!	1
This restaurant offers the most award-winning food anywhere in this town. You will dine in a room filled with hundreds of hand-painted tiles and style fountains, which set the ambiance for a memorable evening coupled with the most delicious dinner ever. Be sure to order a pitcher of Sangria. It's the bomb!	1
Best ever experience! It was all simply decadent. There was a prompt and friendly waiter. Their five stars were easily won!	1
This culinary Mecca is on every ‚Äúmust eat‚Äù list for a reason. The menu was a bit confusing but the waiter proved that no menu was needed. He laid out a three course meal that catered to our cravings. Every bite proved to be heavenly bliss on the palate. Every step of the dining experience was perfection. The only regret you‚Äôll have in not coming with a bigger appetite!	1
One of the best restaurant ever! The entries are simply to die for. Try out the huge selection of incredible appetizers. I would eat here every day if I could afford it!	1
Great food! I had a the lamb pasta , it was delicious the pasta was so soft, like clouds and the lamb just melts in your mouth. Definitely going back. The have a nice area outside for us who like to get out during Covid times . And they are open late which is nice	1
We love the taste of the food from this restaurant. It was a weekend when we visited this restaurant. The place was so spacious and clean. It was so cozy and fancy as well. The food was served fast and well plated. The waiter was so polite and clean. My sister and I had the best dine-in experience in this restaurant.	1
This authentic Italian restaurant with mostly an Italian staff features some of the most amazing dishes that find some of the BEST in the country.	1
My best colleague and I decided to go to a restaurant nearby. The staff greeted us with that big smile, and they directly showed us to our seats. The menu also explained thoroughly, and they will answer all your questions happily. The food was both beautifully presented and delicious. I will never forget this wondrous experience!	1
Very reasonable. It's an eating place near me so it can't be as compared to different stand alone food resto.	1
One of my favorite locations for delicious Italian food. I love visiting here. Service is consistently great. Prices are appropriate.	1
We've been here of course before COVID, ALWAYS delicious! Made it out tonight for their first night back, beyond amazing! Factory kitchen didn't skip a beat! Do your self a favor, make a reservation and go get you some freshly made pasta!	1
last night was the first time we went to this restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We enjoyed the evening a lot with the good service, with the finest cuisine and fine drinks and with the modest price. We will definitely go back there soon.	1
I truly loved this place in my entire life! Honestly, every time I came here, I felt refreshed and happy. The foods were delicious and tasty. Even the drinks, it was OK. Also, the ambiance was clean, comfortable, and stylish. I mean, everything here was perfect and a good choice to visit again and again. Thank you. Till next time! 	1
A preferred place for delicious italian food. definitely one of the best places in the area. certainly worth going back to. prices that won't break you.	1
italian food and service at this spot is very good. arrived at seven, it wasn't crowded. the service was very helpful and welcoming. the place has a cool feel to it.	1
Ok location for quality italian food. Got there about two, it was not packed. Prices that are reasonable. Menu is like a cafe in Boston I liked.	1
Ok location for quality italian food. Service is typically above par. It has an awesome atmosphere. Menu is like a place in Miami I enjoyed	1
italian food and the setting here is better than most. Everyone at our table was quite pleased. Certainly worth a return trip. Menu is like a place in San Francisco I liked.	1
italian food and the feeling here is quality. Visited about four, it was not full. The service was friendly and observant. This place has a great feel to it. 	1
I decided to try this restaurant yesterday for lunch, and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal! The restaurant itself is classy and well-designed. The employees are extremely polite, which I think is the hallmark of the city's hospitality. If you're looking for good food, this is a great choice! Check out my pictures for an idea of their menus!	1
This is no ordinary Italian restaurant. I visited for dinner in a party of four and was treated to some of the finest Italian cuisine that I have ever experienced. You don‚Äôt see the usual Italian staple dishes on the menu here - Angelo and his great chefs are far too knowledgable and creative for that. What you can expect are dishes created with the utmost attention to detail resulting in sublime multi-layered flavouring and great presentation. The outstanding food combined with attentive waiting staff served in a warm and friendly atmosphere make this a great venue for all occasions.	1
This was the first time I visited this restaurant, and I am very grateful that I found this incredible place. I was not expecting this place could be this amazing. I will definitely be going to visit this place again and again for sure. I will also bring my family and friends as well. The most fabulous place! The best of the best service! 	1
It's an Italian restaurant, with many good options. The food is delicious. we went there with friends and shared different dishes. The restaurant is located in Downtown LA Art District and it has a valet parking available. they are open for lunch and dinner. Service was good and the desert was awesome .	1
Great customer service, amazing food. 2nd time here and its the best. Ive only been here during lunch time on a week day its usually very empty but as we were leaving it was getting full. I think any other time it will be very busy, so reservations are probably the best bet.	1
The ambiance is out of this world with class, however it still manages to feel like a family, I don‚Äôt know how they do it! The food is like heaven in your mouth, I have never tasted dishes so good. I highly recommend 	1
Everything we had was fantastic. The prosciutto had so much flavor, and coupled with the burratta, was just amazing. The gnocchi was cooked perfectly and the veal ragu had so much depth of flavor. My wife had the seafood ravioli, which was very rich and very flavorful. The bread putting was a wonderful dessert to end a great dinner. My wife and I enjoyed watching the fresh pasta being rolled out and the slicing of the prosciutto.	1
Good service Variety of options Yummy food Awesome interiors Five stars! 	1
Great good and service. A bit noisy but worth it. Beautiful place. No outdoor sitting. Great bar. The pasta was amazing. Really unique. Good coffee too. 	1
A Italian restaurant located in a loft area that we will definitely visit again. Quite and responsive services! You got plenty of choice on pasta choices! They are always homemade with good textures and unbelievable amazing sauces. Price is reasonable. But the restaurant is quite busy, good to have reservation before visiting.	1
Yum yum yum Great service with awesome foods! Don‚Äôt missed it!!	1
Trendy, great Italian or Italian fusion place. This place in arts district reminds me of Manhattan a little. Great ambiance. Great food. It can be pricy or not depending on if you share. I always share and you can sample more. The prosciutto appetizer is a must try. The tiramisu is also amazing. 	1
It was my first time dining at this Italian restaurant. It's in downtown L.A.'s Art District. It was a factory building before. The food is delicious here; pastas are handmade. You can watch them prepare the food, if you wish. We came here as a group for dinner, and tasted various dishes: I'll list a few. Some ortolana salad, arugula salad, fried frittula and parma prosciutto & stracciatella cheese were great starters. Definitely get the prosciutto with cheese! The green pesto handkerchief pasta (Mandelli di Setta) was silky, yummy and filling; I've never had anything like this before. The thinly sliced wine-cured beef was also good. I didn't care so much for the Casonzei and mushroom focaccina. I loved the apple pie dessert with ice cream. The bread pudding was pretty good too.	1
A little hard to find this place but oh man are you rewarded when you do. Service is great and the pastas here are outstanding. The handkerchief pasta in particular stands out but honestly everything is good here. Make sure to save room for dessert as the cannoli is delicious!	1
I will echo the other reviewers in saying that the service here is excellent, and the food is truly delicious. Very tasty dishes, homemade pasta, hearty sauces, and creative flavors. This restaurant gives you all the hearty flavor-filled Italian dishes you're used to, but with a little bit of extra flair. To some, it can certainly come off as pretentious, but the staff clearly is devoted to the food and their customers, and I look forward to bringing more people to this restaurant - despite its popularity, its location still makes it feel very much like a hidden gem.	1
Favorite Italian spot is Art District DTLA. Make sure to try the pepperu and Prosciutto. 	1
The dishes were delicious all around! We tried their mushroom pizza which was loaded with fresh mushrooms and had a crust stuffed with ricotta cheese. We also had the handkerchief pasta, and the truffle pasta both of which had delicious notes of their respective flavors without overwhelming. Finished off with the banana pudding.	1
Wow! Amazing atmosphere and customer service. Pasta is made fresh as you watch. The pasta itself is some nog the best I've had as is the flavours. Cannot recommend enough!	1
The food is exceptional for pasta lovers. Great presentation. No gluten free pasta dishes though. I got a pasta with duck and it tasted terrific! The drinks are unique and expensive even during lunch hour. They put a ton of ice in each mixed drink, which really makes it a flavored ice drink in my opinion. I would order from their wine list instead.	1
The prosciutto is one of the most interesting dishes with amazing crispy chewy dough and generous cheese and prosciutto - very rich. The sanremese calamari salad is dressed perfectly and fresh, and a great alternative to fried calamari that every Italian restaurant has. The porchetta is incredibly fatty and fragrant, if you don‚Äôt mind gaining a pound or two. I thought the handkerchief pasta was interesting, but not mind blowing so I‚Äôm fine with just trying it once, but I return for the others I mentioned.	1
First time here got the arugula salad and pork belly as my main it was probably the best pork belly I had. The place it self is different good. 	1
Might be my favorite restaurant right now in LA...so delicious...you must get the pesto... 	1
The service was great. It is located in a small street in the Art District of Los Angeles but was crowded during the lunch. This is not a place for vegetarians but is a good restaurant. I was only able to eat the egg dish since most had pork in it. I wasn't sure if I could leave since the waitress had already served water and was very nice. My friend ordered some pork dish and I ordered the egg dish. He loved the food. The check was about $50 which I thought a little bit pricey for lunch. Nonetheless I give it a 5 stars for its excellent service and environment. I always judge a place by its service to see if the money is well spent.	1
Hip, happening, modern and classic Italian cuisine. Come for the food and the vibe...watch them making the pasta...	1
This spot never fails to deliver. They serve fresh dishes for fair rates, there no long wait even when the place is loaded.	1
Oh my goodness, this place is amazing!!! The food is out of this world! MUST TRY! An absolute gem of a restaurant in LA.	1
What can I say, My family was very hungry. Definitely fixed our Italian cravings. We had prosciutto, gnocchi with lamb sauce, 2 kinds of pizza, fried chick pea & flower blossom, seafood ravioli, 2 kinds of pasta dishes, piedmont wine, panna cotta and gelato. Service was perfect. Staff was very attentive.	1
Attended a work lunch and the place was jam packed. Food and cocktails were phenom, can't wait to go for dinner. Definitely a share plate spot. Delicious!	1
Gastro phenomenal!! Venue, service and food exceed expectations every since visit.	1
This spot always delivers. They have excellent food for fair prices, there no long wait even when they are busy.	1
Five star delicious food service. Staff are very friendly and helpful! Wanna back again later soon! 	1
Cool, trendy atmosphere. Excellent service. Everything was delicious!	1
Fantastic service. Everyone talks about the mandilli di seta (the handkerchief pasta), and for good reason. It's a very unique combination of texture and flavor that is so satisfying. For my daughter and me, it tickles a part of our brains that nothing else in the world can. We keep coming back for it. For my wife it's just pretty good. Definitely recommend getting several dishes and sharing amongst the group. Valet parking is $6 in the day and $8 in the evening which is very much on the cheaper side for parking in Downtown LA.	1
Great welcoming service and awesome food! 	1
Cant remember the name of my dish, but it was incredibly delicious. Pasta, ham, pork sausage and prosciutto. Parmesan cheese on top. It was on of the best Italian dishes I've ever had. Thank you for the hospitality.	1
Amazing food! I would definitely come again!!	1
Very good food, but it will cost you. The menu does change on a regular basis.	1
Italian food and the scene here is better than most. came in on a weds. staff treated us so nice. prices were fair.	1
Excellent for authentic Italian. Many of the ingredients are from Italy or locally grown. I got the Casonzei and it was fantastic!!! 	1
I love this place a lot. theres a romantic spirit. The food is exeptionaly good. the service is dynamic and the crew is professional. The price is modest. very much recommend.	1
The food here is expensive, but very good. It caters to local fashion district and artistic crowd in the area. I've been here twice now. The pasta is fresh and flavorful. The appetizers are interesting and well portioned. I have yet to taste something average. Try it for a business lunch or a nice dinner. Trendy...but not ostentatious.	1
A preferred place for italian food. The food was so savory. Really nothing but great experiences here, so I will be back. Menu is like a cafe in Indianapolis I liked.	1
It's very good, fantastic service, the food is just shy of excellent.	1
Good & nice Italian food....kind service, price little	1
Really good, fair price, you can see it small but is not, it fits you just as perfect, so romantic, the food is delicious and the attention was incredible, definitely coming back, recommend it 100% please go, and let me know how delicious was. You should take a look in the desserts, are amazing!	1
Yummy food.	1
Fantastic food, really nice atmosphere, surprisingly very friendly patrons. On the pricey side but definitely worth a visit 	1
amazing fresh pasta, service was great and the desserts were perfect	1
The restaurant was clean with great lighting and vibe. The staff was warm and welcoming. Every last bite of the food was amazing. It was magical and make for an absolutely fantastic dinner!	1
Service was professional, warm, and attentive. Food was as good as it gets-- inside or outside Italy. Decor is perfect for the zone.	1
italian food and service at this place is great. Don't worry if it's busy, it is worth the wait. Service treated us so kindly. The bill was decent. Feels similar to a restaurant in New York I loved.	1
Really great low key place! It‚Äôs medium sized and even with a lot of people, wasn‚Äôt too loud. I got the gnocchi and it was really good, definitely recommend. Portion size was perfect too, just enough to feel full. Parking was really tough as I didn‚Äôt want to valet, so definitely better to uber if it‚Äôs cheaper than valet parking. If you bring your own car, be ready to drive around the block for 15 mins to get parking.	1
Fantastic food and atmosphere. I highly recommend a visit. The staff is exceptional and they have a reasonable wine list	1
I won't go back... My plate was so salty, even my salad. I had two others there with me who agreed so I'm not exaggerating. Service was standard, as the menu speaks for itself. I will say, I really didn't like all water boys/men (way too many) just standing there watching over us, now that is exaggerated. Sorry but I'm not one to have someone at my beckon call when I eat over some water. All and all forr the price of the little bit of food I ate & service, yah I won't ever go back...	0
Slow service, food was so salty we couldn't eat it	0
Expensive for the volume of food. Didn't recognize anything on the menu. Too trendy for me, but it was packed. May be for more of a foodie.	0
overly salty food, disappointing	0
too much salt in everything, very little quantity. I would say the other reviews are quite pretentious	0
junk	0
Cancelled my order then was rude on the phone	0
They got my order wrong, and then they "fixed" it, but still didn't get the order rt & they looked bothered to correct it. Everyone makes mistakes, but they should have been as polite as I was patient. I left and I still didn't get what I ordered & paid for.	0
The place it self is extremely dirty at eye sight. Also, the wait time was insane. We ordered two burgers, and both were equally gross. One burger was dry while the other one was under cooked, wet and over sauced.	0
The fish sandwich was burned, second one has no taste, chilli fries was too oily	0
Too expensive two cheeseburger combo for $25	0
So.....I gave this have a few chances. First time I ordered thru Postmates I was impressed. The second time, it was pretty bad, but still figured it was an off night. Nope. Third time and it's TERRIBLE. I wish I could attach a picture, but their idea of an Asada TACO is just a bunch of over cooked meat and soggy tortillas. No pico , no sauce, nothing but just the meat and tortilla. Are you joking?	0
Good luck getting your order right.	0
Food is not so great. The cooks are creeps.	0
Not cool. Waited 20 minutes for my order. Then when i asked about my order, it took another 10 minutes. And to top it off, my kid gets sick. Just like i told the big lady in the front. I specifically stated to her that my chicken strips were not cooked long enough. Never again.	0
Food is not great and atmosphere is depressing. 	0
Troys has really stepped it down. Just got a burger and fries and it was unpleasant. Not the first time I have been disappointed here. It tasted like a school hamburger.	0
Not what I expected from my high school years	0
The worst hamburger in the world.	0
I recieved food poisening from there steak sandwich here on Dec 2015 won't be back ever I was stuck in bed for two days with fever and sum	0
Too expensive.	0
It's a pretty good place to grab a quick bite but the parking sucks just like most places there's never enough parking space . 	0
The place was nice and clean, but the food was frozen packaged that they just reheat. Not the best.	0
I was the only customer and why was the service do slow? I ask for an item, employee walks away for 30 seconds to chat and then come back. This happened over and over for each item ordered. I had purchased about 5 items and took over 5 mins before I can be rung up. The food was below average. Never going back there.	0
This place is closed.	0
It had one sale man at the counter for cashier and serve food. He had the bad attitude toward customer. He shouldn't be serve the customer.	0
It's not the cleanest place and it's cash only. Even though I've been here many times, I don't recommend this place unless you're here already and are okay with eating subpar dimsum.	0
I found a hair in one of my sandwiches and ever since then I cannot eat at this restaurant without thinking about throwing up. I will never go here again that was disgusting and I can‚Äôt believe no one else has complained about this. It‚Äôs disgusting.	0
3 times in a row that I get stale and cold fry‚Äôs. Mcchicken bun was hard and the chicken patty was inedible. They need to get their quality up.	0
They got the order wrong 3 times and in the end the food was cold	0
Everytime I go here the always park me and no one in the drive threw and to top it off the Male manager said what you want cold food smh	0
I bought this after 5pm. Good job McDonald‚Äôs keep up the good work.	0
Treated very disrespectfully they forgot to order me something and called the manager when i was double checking my items. Through food away and went to taco bell. There right across the street so head on over	0
When I place the order I was missing something at the window they told me that I need to go back to the drive thru to order them again and these is couple that they don't put the order correct.	0
They don't put your order in correctly	0
Breakfast crew is slow	0
There's a cashier there that gave me the wrong change back from a $2.59 order. I gave her $10.75 and got back $1.16. They said I was wrong and I left my name & #, they counted the drawer & nobody called me. The called later that day & was told I had $4.00 there to pick up. Wrong again with the amount ! Make sure you get back the correct change if you go there...	0
I ordered sausage and egg mcmuffin and got ham and egg mcmuffin. Just a quik order off the 99 ruined my breakfast	0
The food was so nasty, fries where super dry and had a bitter taste to them, the hot and spicy chicken Sandwich was super dry and it wasn‚Äôt even hot. If I could give it zero stars I would	0
Waited for my food for 20 mins asked for sauce and got none! And my food was ice cold. Ridiculous. I used to work here and they treat their employees horribly to top it off.	0
Burnt, crusty sausage. It actually looked like a raisin. Also, they gave me TWO bottom buns on my chicken sandwich. ANDDD they put the very end of the tomato( the part you're supposed to throw away) on there as well. AND THE WHOLE SANDWICH SMELLED LIKE ROTTEN SAUCE. I do NOT reccomend. The smoothies were good tho lol	0
Worst experience ever!!! All I said I wanted was a number 2 combo large, 2 sausage egg mcmuffins, and a OJ. I said it 5 times to 3 different people and they kept getting it wrong. Not until I said the number 2 was a cheeseburger meal, then they said they wont serve lunch for 8 more mins. No one said that and I didnt know, since other McDonald's I been to serve lunch at 10am or even 11am. So I left with something extra I paid for that I didnt want and left without my other meal I wanted. Normally i dont ask for it, but i want something to be done about this!	0
As I was paying for my food the other night, the manager walked over to count the drawer. She was staring right at me, rudely! I asked her is she knew me to which she shook her head no, and the rolled her eyes, and kept staring before she walked away. She is also the same manager that yelled at customers to leave if they thought the newbie was taking too long at the register. SMH. That McDonald's has the biggest turnaround with staff...it's no wonder.	0
I didnt get anything new and it really made me wonder why it would take 23 min for 2 breakfast meals? On top of that it didnt make me feel good for the rest of the day.	0
Fires where not fresh. Taste like they been out on counter for while. And my big mac was a mess. Just tossed it in the trash. 	0
Messed up my order again. Someone else wanted to take make order. Ordered dine in order placed to go so we left	0
Broken ice cream machine on a hot day. Only to find out in the middle of a busy drive through.	0
This place sucks!! Horrible service!!! I ordered a hamburger and it came without the meat!!! Just buns! 	0
Ordered three apple pies. Must been old. Dry as the dirt	0
That sucks	0
They never have pies or the cookies I want. I don't mind the wait but I don't even get the option offered to me. It's been 4 times already.	0
Not a fan	0
How much how much more can they charge us and how much smaller can they make their food 	0
Customer service very poor. Got up to pay at the drive through and wanted to add. Was told to go around again Nd pay. What the ....	0
As usual still put pickles in the burger after i told her i didnt want them! 	0
They always have something broken or run out. This time they didn't have SODA! 	0
The bathrooms are dirty.	0
This McDonald's service sucks. Staff doesn't care about your order. I had a mobile order and was trying to ask for help, but seemed that the cashier was blowing me off and just told me to wait til it was submitted through the system. Um, hello!!! I'm running late for work...	0
Drive thru was very slow today.. 	0
Slow was on lunch waited 15 min for my food and then at the desk told me thier outta smoothies very bad service !!!! Need to train thier people better especialy cashiers they seem lost	0
The service is really bad, when ever I order a bunch of burgers they mostly always get the number wrong.If I say I wanted 12 mcchickens they would end up giving me like ten or simple orders at times where you just ask for ketchup on the burger.Although I do like McDonald‚Äôs this one is not just the right one for me.	0
They made 6 cars pull over and wait. If tbis is the practice, they need to HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES! Not returning here!	0
Food cold	0
This place us to be ok. But now i alway get cold fries and stale food. I also have to run to the bathroom after eating here. I wish they'd go back to how they use to be.	0
Service is slow. Always want you to park and wait for them to bring your order out. 	0
I hate McDonald's because they push so hard for you to use the kiosks to order .	0
This place is packed and horrible	0
Always gets the order wrong and takes forever 	0
If your only taking cash put a sign up before you get into the drive thru not when there are 6 cars behind you and your at the menu ready to order! Poor poor management poor planning poor customer service! I should have learned the last few times with the crappy service I received. Next time I‚Äôll just take the extra time and drive to Selma!	0
The bathroom was super nasty	0
Food was bad went to go get fresh food and got food back refried instead nuggets wear missing drive-thru service was terrible attitude of employees was bad When food was finally brought to me was rudely asked the try before I left to make sure that it was was done right this time	0
I asked for a boneless burger and they hung up....... how rude 	0
Worst service ...orders all usually wrong	0
Nasty food	0
I repeated my order three time no mayo and they put extra mayo! and no lettuce! And the manager was very rude didnt offer to fix or make it right! 	0
Slow service	0
Poor service.	0
The manager called my voice stupid when I was folding a complaint on a mess up on my order.	0
Customer service is very bad and service times are slow	0
Been there the last 5 days in a row and it is never open at 5am	0
Friendly but wow does it take forever and always mixing and messing up orders .. thumbs down for this one	0
The manager hung up on me three times becuase I asked a question and called me an idiot then the third time my relative called her and she hung up	0
The manager hung up on me twice because I didn't know what they had on their menu. The only reason I gave them one stars because you can't give them no stars. 	0
It was trrible	0
Be prepared to pull off to the side after you order. The manager does this all the time to try to make their drive thru times look better	0
Was given the wrong order, I attempted to call, it went to voicemail. Mistakes happen	0
This is the second time I've gotten iced coffee from this location and it literally just tastes like sweet milk... so sad.. 	0
This place was disappointing! First they had stuff on there drive thru menu that was already discontinued or no longer available. Then when I have to basically park across the street to wait for my order. They were so slow they have the parking lot full of cars waiting for there orders. That they started sending people across the street to park and wait for there food.	0
Kinda dirty	0
Food was hot which is great. Service could be better. They had one person at the counter taking your order, took a very long time to get your food. They did apologize about the wait. Everyone was polite.	0
It's McDonald's, food is good but fries are half empty even when asked to make sure it's actually full.	0
Poor service	0
Meh. Service but no personality or character. I always feel like I am bothering them for food. Just sayn	0
Food was very cold.guess I should have known as they were very slow.	0
Its ok if u like frozen patties and bad service go to fowler mcdonalds where u get bad coffee all the time plus I just seen a guy worker put his dirty hands in the ice like it was the normal thing to do 	0
Did McDonald's change its meat formula? 1/4 Pounder tasted like some kind of soy mixture. Plain cheeseburger did as well.	0
Super slow. Tons of people working all at a crawl	0
When you're hungry even garbage looks appealing. Solid 2 stars.	0
Fowler McDonald's is not always good. They seem to screw order up 8 out of 10 times.	0
They need to get on the ball st this place. Customer service is headed toward a downward spiral	0
it is not good.	0
it is not bad.	1
it's bad.	0
it's good.	1
Great atmosphere and service. Happy hours on Tuesday night is one of the best time to try out their menu. Lots of great choices for wine lovers!	1
Outstanding service, great tapas and wine selection. Some tapas a little slow coming out but that's not always a bad thing on a Friday night! Food good enough to make it worth the wait. Chocolate flan and Ruby Port to top it off. We'll be back.	1
I had really bad experience today. I ordered the pickup order couple hours ago through the website with a specific time and I waited for more than 45 minutes before I finally got attention to the manager to finally get the order. I called the restaurant the moment I arrived, and within these 45 minutes I called another 4 times and each time it was a different person telling me they would check. I understand this is a hard time for restaurants but I see waves of people coming to dine-in and with me trying to obey the social distancing to order curbside and get this kind of experience where apparently the waitress just don‚Äôt care and fine I won‚Äôt come again.	0
Food was good but the meals are made to fill up a four year old they are so small 60 dollars later we are going to order Chinese from China king	0
Carry out is terrible, literally had to wait 30 minutes over the time I was given for pick up. Despite checking with them multiple times, the carry out structure is a mess and because of that I am giving this place 1 star.	0
Food is bad for the price, service horrible. I felt very uncomfortable eating there.	0
We were seated at 6:45 and my meal hadn‚Äôt arrived when we left at 8:20. My sisters and I had a 6:45 reservation and were seated quickly. It was ten or fifteen minutes until the waitress stopped by our table, so we ordered drinks and our meals at the same time to keep things moving. The next time  our waitress stops by - half an hour later - she is surprised to see that two of us don‚Äôt have our food. At 7:55, my sister‚Äôs meal finally arrives, and I‚Äôm reassured mine is coming soon. At 8:10, the waitress lets me know that it will be a while longer, and we tell her we‚Äôll just be leaving. She leaves to get the check for the drinks and my sisters‚Äô meals. At 8:20, without ever having received my meal or even the check for our drinks and my sisters‚Äô meals, we leave cash on the table and leave. There are endless great restaurant options on Southwest Boulevard and nearby Crossroads. Pick literally anywhere else.	0
I'm so sad. My boyfriend and I took my son out- just home from college- for what we thought would be an amazing dinner- based on our past experiences. Honestly, truly, my very expensive drink tasted like water with lime juice. Same with my boyfriend's drink. Not a good sign when every dish needs table salt added. Would have ordered more food, including dessert- maybe gambled on another drink. Instead we were given the check in passing and our credit card and receipt were returned in the same manner. This was our "really special-save up money- twice a year kinda $$$ that we really don't have" evening. I am so disappointed	0
weird taste, crowded seating, awkward parking, trip when leaving, overall a disappointment	0
The food : not bad, the staff !! I didn‚Äôt feel welcome at all. The girl who received us on the front door ‚Äú I think she want to kick us out‚Äù looking at us by disguising look! Putting my plates so far from me! I didn‚Äôt enjoy my food because of this!!	0
I don't remember me servers name, however will NOT be coming back. Felt as if it was an awkward atmosphere. DID NOT feel comfortable and didn't look very clean back in the kitchen area.	0
Server was ridiculously untrained.  Will be a while before I return.  Too many other wonderful restaurants on the Boulevard to enjoy.	0
Disrespectful staff, waiter/waitress no where to be found. My wife and I were seated with our sleeping 7 month old next to the loudest table in the place and was asked to place him on the ground under our table. After waiting 20 min and getting no table service we had no choice but to leave. Do your self a favor and find a better establishment to spend your money.	0
It is my worst experience for my guests and I here in Kansas City Restaurant called "La Bodega". First, I order a Grilled chicken/ Pollo a la Parrilla with Cheese and Pincho de Pollo y Chorizo, waiting for 10 min, and they told that they have 1 Grilled Chicken only around 2:30pm, well I ordered a different dish for my friend, 5 min later they told us they don't have the other dish that we ordered. Finally, Everyone ordered different dishes, and those were raw. Very disappointed. The manager told us, sorry it happens! I never make bad comments because I understand that businesses have good and bad things, but the truth is that this was my worst experience. I felt worse for inviting my friends to a place like this!!!	0
We had a nice sized bill with the worst service ever!  I will not be going back here anytime soon.  We waited an hour for 4 meatballs and some toast with goat cheese on it.  Ridiculous.	0
The pitcher of sangria had no fruit, and filled with ice. Just a few slices of Apple in a wine glass.  Way over priced for the service.  The outdoor seating is very noisy, it sits under a highway overpass. Not worth the money.	0
Disrespectful staff, poor service and a lack of urgency. Waited for 45 minutes for a sandwich that takes 5 minutes to make. Don't waste your time.	0
The food was awful.	0
Don't  like it, to much fat!	0
Music is terrible no alternate options in menu seats out side are terrible feels like I'm going to get a bloat just sitting also bees and flies every where.	0
Such a charming, quirky little spit to grab some breakfast and coffee! The staff even drew little cartoons on our coffee cups! I had the Sink (?) which was a box full of potatoes, eggs, chorizo, pico, cheese, and salsa verde. It was huge and really tasty! My wife got the Pigs in a blanket. Basically crepes around sausages with eggs on the side. If we are ever back in KC, we‚Äôll be back!	1
Outstanding place for quality Brunch. I love this place, great food & service. Service treated us so kindly. The bill was fair I would say. I see why this place has so many great reviews.	1
Didn't eat here. Tried to go for breakfast but no one seemed to know what was going on. No hostess, a bunch of people standing around. Couldn't tell if you ordered and then sat down or if that line was just for take out...	0
Overpriced, tasteless, rude staff. Won't return.	0
Not impressed. Overpriced, food sub par quality, employees cluelessly running around with no idea what‚Äôs going on.	0
Don‚Äôt waste your money here. Rude employees.	0
The place is hip and cool but food is like at a cheap diner. I‚Äôve never had a flatter omelet and portabella mushrooms inside were still cold. My latte came with food in about 30 min (!) and was not good....potatoes were cold. The service wasn‚Äôt the best either. Street parking was easy.	0
Don't use them for catering!! Services promised were not rendered. Ran out of drinks for kids and adults at our wedding reception after 30 minutes. We had to find our own bartender the DAY before our wedding because, all of a sudden they didn't have the staff to accommodate this (even though we were told they would). Owner is very rude and difficult to work with. Best to just use someone else.	0
Ordered takeout and was quoted 15 minutes showed up and waiting via instructions was told food would be ready in a minute. Asked a server after 20 minutes of waiting if our food was ready and turns out it was and had been just sitting their getting cold. Was then told by the server we were rude for getting her attention to ask for our food.	0
Rude staff. Were there two hours and never got any food. After 30 minutes after we ordered we were told it take an hour to get our food. So we just left. People that came in after us we're getting their food. If you're looking for bad service  and a unclean place to eat. This would be the perfect restaurant for you.	0
Absolutely horrible. We had bugs in our food!!! And the employees were rude!	0
Told 20 minute wait and to wait outside in the cold or back by the kitchen. Then the staff kept telling us to get away from the kitchen but there was no place to go. After waiting 45+ minutes for a table we ordered... And waited over an hour for our food... We finally left when we were told-- "didn't they tell you it would be an hour before you get your food even after you get your table?" No. They didn't. We left with out food.	0
Unapologetically closed early.	0
Too weird of an atmosphere for me. :/ Didn't feel comfortable here. I ended up not eating because my friend and I felt so uncomfortable. Just honestly too weird.	0
This business supports Planned Parenthood! Looking forward to a wonderful brunch and walked out due to their signs everywhere for their plannted parenthood fundraiser. Stick to your good food and stay out of politics.	0
First time here. Can‚Äôt be seated until your whole party is in. Can‚Äôt order a drink at the bar while you wait. I will likely never come back due to the poor service which stinks because I love juice and the menu looks good. Terrible customer service	0
Waited an hour only to be told that their system wasn‚Äôt working and they and texted us... yet we received no text. Service was average and the atmosphere was very unwelcoming. The food was the most disappointing. Nothing special about this place at all.	0
Came here for breakfast while we were in KC and it was terrible. In fact, we ended up leaving without eating at the restaurant after sending back our pancakes twice because they weren‚Äôt at all cooked. But don‚Äôt worry, after all that they still charged us for our juices. Really terrible experience.	0
Great food! Service was excellent. Clean space, fresh product. Food arrived warm and exactly as described in the menu. Definitely going back!	1
Great food, excellent service. The Cafe is adorable. Love the menu.	1
Amazing food and great service! I recommend their fresh juice! I plan on going back next week.	1
I‚Äôve lived as far as the west coast and have never experienced brunch quite like Succotash. The service is always amazing with unique personalities I adore. Not only is the food and service on parr, but the progressive values are a huge perk creating a really accepting atmosphere. There‚Äôs a reason you wait an hour to be seated and it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs worth the wait.	1
Wonderful food as always. Fastest I have ever gotten my food. Due to covid there is no seating inside but you can walk up, order food, and sit out side.	1
An amazing spot to eat. I got the build your $10 scrambler woth Marble Rye bread. It was amazing. I recommend this place highly.	1
Stopped in for breakfast on the morning of the SuperBowl largely due to good reviews on here. So glad we did! It's a blend of old-fashioned and modern at the same tie. I ordered the special red velvet pancakes that they had in honor of the Chiefs making it to the SuperBowl and they were outstanding. They literally outdid themselves by making a Chiefs arrowhead with yellow frosting on my cakes (see pic)	1
We had and unexpected hospital stay for our newborn back in January. Succotash was a welcome ray of sunshine in our stay. Great service, amazing food, and decor that tells you that you have come the right place.	1
Two words: Pork Hash. Wow, was it delicious! It's pricy at $13, but it's worth it at least once. We had excellent service. The place was jam packed with people waiting outside, but they still got us in sooner than they said they would. We were in a hurry to see a show at Crown Center, and our waitress accommodated us very well. We want to come back soon to try more menu items!	1
Nice site for quality brunch. Don't fret if it's busy, it is worth the wait. I've had nothing but great experiences here and will keep coming back.	1
Brunch, so great. This location is absolutely outstanding. Definitely worth a return trip. Prices were reasonable.	1
The squash omelet was to die for! Very friendly service and very good with keeping up to date and on top of the covid regulations. Way to push through the struggle!	1
From the Rosemary caramel latte to the pancake burrito everything was outstanding! The fun eclectic decor just adds to the charm! If you're in the Kansas City area you must check this place out!!!	1
The food was delicious, biscuits and gravy with French toast!	1
Oh my goodness, this place is amazing! I don't know how I've never been here before. Our waitress was fantastic and recommended several things. We settled on splitting the smoked salmon salad (freaking amazing ‚ù§) and the gluten-free Maggie Cristo. I also the rosemary caramel latte, which was just as good as the food. There were so many ways to customize what you wanted, and I'm so excited to go back and try more amazing food.	1
Got the Bodybuilder and loved it. The Cubano juice is a little too cucumber-heavy, but everything  was great overall.	1
SO GOOD!!!! Staff is EXCELLENT and the food is incomparable! You have to try Succotash! While my pictures are not the best as we got take out, I‚Äôve never had a better grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup. Highly recommend!!	1
One of my favorite breakfast spots :)	1
Great food, quick service, generous portions. Take out only right now due to COVID, but their patio was perfect to sit in with my food!	1
My absolute FAVORITE breakfast/brunch joint! My boyfriend and I try to go every Sunday and have never been disappointed! The service is consistently satisfying, the atmosphere is cozy and hip the decor is funky and fun, and the food... ohman... it‚Äôs mouth watering to think about and even better to eat! The Rosemary Caramel Latte is probably one of the best lattes I‚Äôve ever had! I get it every time I go and my boyfriend always gets the Cubano juicer. Their Benedicts are fabulous and the Specials are always very unique and popping with flavor. It‚Äôs off the beaten path being located in a neighborhood but something you don‚Äôt want to miss! There‚Äôs almost always a wait or line when we go (between 10:30am-1pm) so be prepared to possibly wait, but it‚Äôs worth it!	1
I love this neighborhood treasure! Great food and atmosphere! The coffee is from "Oddly Correct". Strong and tasty! Excellent and friendly staff and service! Very worth the wait!	1
Relaxed atmosphere, fresh ingredients, and a litany of delicious juices and coffees. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique mainstay to the KC area	1
Vegan pancakes!!! And the coffee was just what I needed. Strong but not bitter! It‚Äôs a honey of a spot. So glad this Minneapolis gal found it!	1
Eclectic. Funky. Hip. Cozy. Fun. Satisfying. The different hashes & breakfasts are phenomenal! Nice mix of breakfasts & lunch dishes made with a special culinary flair. They've got traditional  comfort style food (think eggs, beef, salads, pork, bacon, burgers) but also vegan, gluton free, and hallal.  We had The Modern Elvis - a vegan take on french toast with peanut butter, bananas, & caramel that tastes awesome (warning! also heavy & rich), vegan pancakes with fruit bowl, & a traditional short stack. Everything was fabulous (& we aren't even vegan). If you haven't eaten here yet, you are missing great food and a unique experience. Come once, you'll come back.	1
Service was amazing, food was great. I wish there was a little more space for waiting. The Southwest kitchen sink was delicious	1
brunch and the scene here is very good. Quick, helpful, and friendly service. Prices that won't break you.	1
Great service and even better food. Nice little place to go for a great breakfast with family or friends. I got Swedish pancakes, which came with a side of eggs and bacon!	1
Super cute, quaint, eclectic little breakfast hideaway. Great service. Lots of vegetarian options, but lots for the meat lovers also. I cannot pass up vegetarian biscuits and gravy - oh, so good it was! Friend had the french toast and bacon; my mom ate her leftovers and said fantastic especially the bacon. Fresh squeezed OJ was outstanding. I would go back again in a heartbeat.	1
Huge portions! Delicious quality food and drinks (coffee, latte, fresh pressed juice). Cute hipster goth like decor and staff.	1
Vegan brought me here. Absolutely loved the menu. Ordered the smoked salmon club without bacon & a side of home fries. Was incredibly delicious. The "best lemonade" very refreshing. Atmosphere was unique & fun. Staff was knowledgeable & helpful.	1
Really good variety of food that all tastes delicious.	1
Whew. The food is SO good here! Love the art and atmosphere. I went on a Friday morning and the place already had a wait list. Very impressive! I ordered the Kitchen Sink and it did not disappoint. I also got a juice, the Cubano, and it was refreshing and flavorful. I look forward to visiting again soon.	1
This cute spot is perfect for breakfast/brunch. The portion sizes are big and so were the smiles! Service was friendly and the flavor was great! Stop in for the french toast and seasonal snickerdoodle latte!	1
We LOVED Succotash. Our only mistake was both getting the spicy BLT on special because it was too tempting and not trying another dish. My husband, a BLT connoisseur (as one when is when they think eggs are ‚Äúicky‚Äù), cites this as his favorite to date. We also loved the fresh squeezed juices. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!	1
This place had some of the best vegan bfast I've had!	1
Busy place when they open so you know it's good! Special was a morel mushroom omelette. Il this place is worth the wait!	1
Wow! What can I say other than AMAZING! I had the Burrito of Love and it blew my world. We sat at the bar and loved how friendly the staff was, the great food, the fun music, and great eclectic atmosphere.	1
Even though the restaurant was very busy (we visited on a Saturday morning), we were seated immediately. We ordered our coffees (rosemary caramel lattes and an Americano) and those took a while to come out, but they were delicious. The food came out shortly after and it was fantastic. Their menu is interesting with a lot of unique dishes, including burritos with pancakes instead of tortillas and a goat cheese/lingonberry/ham sandwich on sourdough French toast. The only thing that could have used improvement was the home fries, which were basically just pan fried potatoes that weren't crispy or seasoned. Overall though, this place was superb and we will definitely be back!	1
Delicious! A surprise delivery of many ready made sandwiches and salad brought to the hospital. This restaurant made fresh food for very appreciative staff workers! It was delicious and I cannot wait until I can have more! Thank you!	1
Solid spot for breakfast and great coffee.	1
I went to Succotash for breakfast with some friends recently for the first time since I was in college over 10 years ago.  I honestly had forgotten about it because I live on the Kansas side.  It was fabulous.	1
Great food. Great staff. Socially responsible patio dining.	1
Very unique restaurant with the decor. I was a lil iffy about dining here, my son picked out the place. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the food was GREAT! I ordered the candied bacon shortstack with maple butter. I didn't realize the bacon would be in the pancakes, OMG but they were so delicious. Orange juice was fresh squeezed. I was totally stuffed, everything was perfect! I would definitely consider visiting again.	1
The food and service was exceptional. I had a cup of tomato bisque to start with, which is one of the better ones I've had. Nothing amazing, but solid flavors. I had the Maggie Cristo for the entree. The blend of goat cheese, lingonberry sauce, and ham all balanced each other very well. The mixture of salty, earthy, sweet, and bitter flavors went together very nicely, but the potatoes could use a little more seasoning. I had the Cup of Sunshine to drink which was superb as well. I don't normally like celery, but it paired well with all the fruit juices.	1
We‚Äôre picky when it comes to food and we found this diamond in the rough on our road trip, and we‚Äôre thoroughly surprised. The gluten free pancakes were especially amazing, but the service was exceptional. Clifford made us feel at home, even on the road! Going to make this a regular stop on our cross country travels home!	1
The staff is friendly and so accommodating. Succotash also makes it a point to support their employees with fair wages and also feed the homeless. The restaurant decor is art deco and all around fun and conversation pieces. Their food is top notch, affordable and they have gluten free options.	1
Great place, oozing with character, great food and friendly service. Eclectic and good energy. Would definitely come back next time in KC.	1
Pancakes as big as your plate and pressed juice to die from. Staff was so attentive and charming.	1
We try to stop here every time we go to KCMO. Fantastic locally sourced food. Always delicious! Something is available for omnivores, vegetarians & vegans alike. Staff are super friendly. Closes in the afternoon, so no dinner here. Great breakfasts!	1
Succotash is a Kansas City Staple. Paris has the Eiffel Tower, Springfield has crystal meth, we've got Succotash. Somehow, it's so hipster that it feels anti-hipster (which, let's face it, is super hipster.) I've never had a bad experience here. The serving style is super laissez-fair, and I don't mean that in a bad way. No one takes themselves that seriously and, in return, you just don't set your bar too high. Once the food comes out and hits your taste buds, it's an overwhelming experience like no other. I could rave about the French toast for days ü§§ and their fresh-squeezed, housemate juices are so gorgeous & delicious. It's like, "Woah! Wasn't expecting that!"	1
Love the atmosphere!  Such a down to earth cool vibe.  Best Cuban sandwich I've ever had! Service is always friendly, feels like home	1
Stopped in for breakfast on the morning of the SuperBowl largely due to good reviews on here. So glad we did! It's a blend of old-fashioned and modern at the same tie. I ordered the special red velvet pancakes that they had in honor of the Chiefs making it to the SuperBowl and they were outstanding. They literally outdid themselves by making a Chiefs arrowhead with yellow frosting on my cakes (see pic). My friend had the pork hash and it looked amazing. The bacon and eggs I had with my pancakes were outstanding and the price was more than reasonable. They even gave us a military discount. They don't have a dedicated parking lot, but don't let that stop you from going in to this place and getting a great breakfast!	1
This might be the best breakfast I've had and it was definitely the best coffee. True coffee artisans! Worth the wait in line but the waiting list through your phone is super cool. The peachy swedes are an incredibly original dish =amazing! Chorizo Southwest hash was really good. It had a lot of extra ingredients like Pico and verde salsa. So good. The blueberry pancakes are incredible! We had a great time, fun atmosphere, great service even though this place was packed and amazing food.	1
Had a party of 18, food and service was great,	1
You know you're in love with a joint when you discover it one day and come back the next with someone else so you can share the experience. The menu is eclectic with flavor combos you wouldn't necessarily think...HUGE, delicious flavors. There's truly something for everyone. And to boot, the staff is incredible. I'll definitely be making another visit...soon!	1
Excellent food and juices. Plenty of vegan and non-vegan options. There is a long wait, but worth the wait. I highly recommend their "vegan kitchen sink" and veggie sausage.	1
Delicious food for normal diets, gluten free, and vegans!! Got seated right away even on a Saturday morning and service was good. Great coffee options!	1
Amazing food. Urban hipster vibe. Great organized menu with many diverse offerings. Portion sizes are very good and justify the cost well. Great option for a brunch.	1
Amazing food with awesome vegetarian and vegan options. So good you may not wanna tell your grandma about it!	1
The food was really good and you got a lot of it . I cant wait to go back and eat there again	1
Trendy brunch eatery. Food was delicious! Try the eggs benedict - you can't go wrong!	1
Beth, the place is phenomenal and so is the food!!  The pork hash tasted great and the portion was generous.  I kept getting distracted by the amazing dishes that were being served around me.  Thank you so much for inviting me down and I look forward to eating there again and again.	1
Wow! The gobbler is the best sandwich I have ever had. More flavor than a burger. House salad was killer too!	1
I didn't know this place was even here or so close to us. It's a pooping little joint. I love that it caters to vegan and vegetarians. You can also substitute the bacon for turkey for chicken if your a meat eater. It's a little in the pricey side but still worth another visit. The water was very helpful also.	1
We were seated right away which was awesome, because it soon got very busy with a line out the door. The food was delicious, options for gluten free and vegans. Atmosphere was fun and eccentric.	1
One of the top places to go to in Kansas. Love the Salmon Eggs Benedict. Ask for an egg over easy as they don't poach eggs there. You won't regret it!	1
LOVE this place! Best brunch in the city, hands down. Delicious affordable food, hip but welcoming staff, creative cool atmosphere! The wait can be long on the weekends but it's definitely worth it!	1
Fun atmosphere, wonderful food, and great service! It was very busy when there, but still received very attentive service. Highly recommend.	1
My favorite place to take out of town guests.  I love succotash and always recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to eat.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  It's a bit noisy with all the people sometimes so if you don't like noisy places, avoid it.  Otherwise, I think you'll love it!	1
My son and I went here while visiting from Omaha for our Father's day trip, and will return the first chance we get! I had the Vegan Sink and it was one of the best vegan dishes I've ever had! My son got the Nutella S'mores French Toast. The food was amazing and the service was exceptional!	1
We came for the Passport program and also got the meatballs. The Egg Nog drink was good and the meatballs were very good. Service and ambience were good as well!	1
Awesome experience.  Ambience is upscale, but the environment warm and welcoming. Menu is diverse and the chef made an accommodation that was outstanding!  Madeleine took incredible care of us and added so much to the dinner experience.  Highly recommend!	1
It was just not good. It had a lot of hype from the hotel front desk staff. Rather than going out to a nicer restaurant we stayed at the hotel and ate there. It is more of a lounge than restaurant, their drink selection was very minimal, my medium rare steak was well done. It was loud having a jazz band there. The service was not great. The drunk man yelling at the tv was icing on the cake. Will not be back and do not recommend.	0
As always, the service was impeccable. Mary took great care of us throughout our drinks, dinner, and dessert.  The Beef Bourginion was delicious as was the (seasonal) Egg Nog,. Cinnamon instead of nutmeg added a neat twist to the drink.	1
The hotel was absolutely amazing.  But the restaurant was absolutely horrible.  I mean who serves a steak with no sides. Will never eat there again.	0
This is my favorite restaurant when I'm staying downtown in Kansas City.  I invariably order the salmon and a couple of glasses of the house red wine.  I can't vouch for anything else, but I could eat that same meal every day.  It's that good.	1
Service average food pretty good very nice atmosphere	1
very good	1
Not much to do due to covid. My daughters favorite thing to do which is feeding the stingrays there was a sign saying they were on a feeding  break till tomorrow. Waste of money! Staff is not really present and girls at aquarium snack stand are to busy talking and on their phones to take orders!  I liked the tiger and exhibit . I didn‚Äôt see anyone wiping down heavy travel areas 	0
A knock off of the Jalisco restaurants. Nothing special about overpriced food. They need a chef to improve their food quality and consistency. Short order cooks are not good enough. 	0
Food was hot but the Carne guisada didn't have a good taste the gray taste like enchilada sauce 	1
Got there at 620. I understand that they open at 6 on Saturdays.. My carne guisada was DRY and the tortilla was dry to the point where it was falling apart. They charged me for cheese yet, there wasnt any. There was an extra ball of foil which was pico de gallo, not cheese like they said. $13 for 3 carne guisada tacos and 1 potato and egg. Ridiculous. 	0
The food was good, but had to return the menudo, only had 4 pieces of tripe, come on really, no bueno 	0
